# Predicting-Codon-based-Traits-Across-Kingdoms
# Project Overview
This study explores the predictive potential of an organism's codon usage bias across genomic and evolutionary traits. Through secondary analysis of extensive genetic datasets, we construct AI/machine learning models utilizing classification algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, and XGBoost. Notably, XGBoost emerges as the most accurate classifier, achieving superior performance in predicting organelle origin and taxonomic identity of nucleotide samples. Guided by a custom feature ranking ensemble, we identify influential codons for phylogenetic prediction, demonstrating the power of genetic code in precise classification of taxonomic and phylogenetic features. Furthermore, our application of this framework to open reading frame (ORF) detection, employing a statistical model to assess ORF plausibility based on codon usage distribution, showcases the versatility and efficacy of our approach. This project bridges the gap between genetic data analysis and predictive modeling, offering insights into evolutionary dynamics and genomic classification
